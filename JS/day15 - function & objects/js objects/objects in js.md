# JavaScript Objects
- An object in JavaScript is a data structure used to store related data collections. 
- It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the associated value. 
- Objects are dynamic, which means the properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.

> There are two primary ways to create an object in JavaScript:
- Object Literal  
- Object Constructor.

> Creation Using Object Literal

        let obj = {
            name: "Dhanraj",
            age: 18,
            job: "Developer"
        };

        console.log(obj);

> Creation Using new Object() Constructor

        let obj = new Object();
        obj.name= "Dhanraj",
        obj.age= 18,
        obj.job= "Developer"

        console.log(obj);
